# Installation

The first task is to have a proper python programming setup. 

## Install the conda package manager

Usually, python is already installed with the operating system (OS). However, when programming, using the OS's python is usually not a good idea:
- You may need a specific version of python for some tasks
- You may cause installation conflicts and create problems for your OS.

There exists several ways of handling multiple python installations, mainly venv, conda and uv. We suggest to use conda as it is well documented and extremely popular. 
Go to the [conda webpage](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and do the necessary steps to install miniconda (anaconda is huge).
